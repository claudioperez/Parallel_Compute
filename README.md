# Parallel_Compute

An example project for domain decomposition and parallel computing.

## Description

This repository demonstrates how to break down a computational domain into quadrilateral elements that can be handled in parallel, which is commonly used in finite element methods (FEM) or scientific computing.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Matplotlib
- Domain Decomposition concepts
